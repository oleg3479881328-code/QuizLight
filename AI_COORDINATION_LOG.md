# AI Coordination Log

## Purpose

Append-only chronological journal of meaningful AI-to-AI coordination events.

Rules:

- append new events at the bottom only;
- never rewrite, reorder, or delete prior events;
- add correction events instead of editing history;
- do not copy the full discussion trail into this file.

## 2026-06-03 16:00:08 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT
Type: Coordination Log Initialized
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Created the append-only coordination journal for QuizLight. Earlier confirmed coordination history is preserved as a baseline summary below because exact timestamps for each earlier event were not recorded in this file at the time they occurred.

Evidence:
- File created: `AI_COORDINATION_LOG.md`
- Snapshot file: `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md`
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/2

Next Step:
Append future meaningful coordination events at the bottom only.

## 2026-06-03 16:00:08 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT
Type: Historical Baseline Imported
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Imported the confirmed baseline state for the current Azure Translator integration review. GitHub Issue #1 was archived for new messages after becoming too long for reliable connector reading. GitHub Issue #2 became the active continuation channel. The current reviewed code state remains blocked pending the final edge-case patch recorded in `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md`.

Evidence:
- Archived channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/1
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/2
- Snapshot file: `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md`
- Latest reviewed implementation commit at import time: `0b7606adda16005c492ebcee3ce821d2e42509a6`
- Current status at import time: `BLOCKED — final edge-case patch required`

Next Step:
Executor applies the remaining edge-case patch, runs validation, pushes one minimal commit, and posts a structured Patch Execution Report in Issue #2.

## 2026-06-03 16:02:59 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT
Type: Correction
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Correction for the two previous imported log entries: their displayed timestamp `2026-06-03 16:00:08 America/New_York` was inserted during initialization without a separately verified runtime clock read. The entries remain preserved because this file is append-only. The correction itself uses the confirmed runtime timestamp shown in this heading.

Evidence:
- Confirmed runtime time zone: `America/New_York`
- Confirmed runtime timestamp at correction creation: `2026-06-03 16:02:59 America/New_York`
- Append-only rule: prior entries preserved unchanged

Next Step:
Use verified concrete timestamps for all future appended events.

## 2026-06-03 — Patch 5 Applied (Commit 9789917)

- **Event:** Applied all items from ChatGPT's fifth review (3 P0 issues).
- **Changes:**
  - `applyRussianSuggestion` now routes through `updateDraft('russian', value)` — increments `russianManualEditVersionRef`.
  - `applyEnglishSuggestion` now routes through `updateDraft('english', value)` — calls `invalidateTranscriptTranslation()`.
  - Added `invalidateTranscriptTranslation()` helper — aborts pending `AbortController` + increments `transcriptRequestIdRef`.
  - `updateDraft` when `field === 'english'` calls `invalidateTranscriptTranslation()`.
  - `resetForm()` calls `invalidateTranscriptTranslation()` + clears `translationProvider` and `translationFallbackNote`.
- **Validation:** `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors. `npx eslint src/App.tsx` — 0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning.
- **Commit:** `9789917` pushed to `origin/master`.
- **AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md:** Updated to `PATCH_APPLIED — awaiting reviewer confirmation`.
- **Status:** Awaiting ChatGPT confirmation in Issue #2.

## 2026-06-03 — Patch 6 Applied (Commit 54fbaa4)

- **Event:** Applied the single P0 item from ChatGPT's sixth review.
- **Changes:**
  - `handleTranslateRuToEn` now routes through `updateDraft('english', result.data.text)` instead of direct `setDraft()`.
  - `handleTranslateEnToRu` now routes through `updateDraft('russian', result.data.text)` instead of direct `setDraft()`.
- **Validation:** `npm run build` — 0 errors. `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning.
- **Commit:** `54fbaa4` pushed to `origin/master`.
- **AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md:** Updated to `PATCH_APPLIED — awaiting reviewer confirmation`.
- **Status:** Awaiting ChatGPT confirmation in Issue #2.

## 2026-06-04 08:31:08 America/New_York

Actor: Oleg Povalyukhin — Project Owner
Type: Scope Change
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
The owner postponed Azure Translator configuration and selected DeepSeek API as the temporary MVP AI provider for broader feature testing. Existing Azure code must remain intact but deferred.

Evidence:
- Owner decision recorded in chat on 2026-06-04.
- Existing Azure fallback behavior remains available.
- API-model runtime cache gate applies to DeepSeek integration.

Next Step:
Create a dedicated DeepSeek integration handoff and migrate the active implementation channel.

## 2026-06-04 08:31:08 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT — Reviewer and Architect
Type: Channel Migration and Handoff Issued
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Created GitHub Issue #3 as the active channel for bounded DeepSeek API integration. The handoff requires server-side secrets, three DeepSeek endpoints, local fallback preservation, AI-generated sense block support, provider labels, and mandatory runtime usage plus cache-hit/cache-miss logging.

Evidence:
- Previous active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/2
- New active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- API runtime gate: `knowledge-library/execution-standards/api-model-runtime-cache-gate.md`
- Official DeepSeek base URL: `https://api.deepseek.com`
- Recommended MVP model: `deepseek-v4-flash`

Next Step:
Executor reads Issue #3, confirms the channel, implements only the bounded DeepSeek MVP integration, validates build and lint, appends one meaningful log event, updates the snapshot, and posts a signed Patch Execution Report in Issue #3.

## 2026-06-04 08:34:20 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT — Reviewer and Architect
Type: Correction Notice
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Correction for the two preceding DeepSeek migration entries: their displayed timestamp `2026-06-04 08:31:08 America/New_York` was inserted before a separate runtime clock verification. The entries remain preserved because this file is append-only. The verified runtime timestamp for this correction is shown in this heading.

Evidence:
- Confirmed runtime time zone: `America/New_York`
- Confirmed runtime timestamp at correction creation: `2026-06-04 08:34:20 America/New_York`
- Append-only rule: prior entries preserved unchanged

Next Step:
Use verified concrete timestamps for future appended coordination events.

Actor: Cline (Codex Agent)
Type: DeepSeek API Integration Implemented
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Replaced Azure Translator with DeepSeek as the active AI provider. Added DeepSeek dev-server middleware in vite.config.ts for /api/translate and /api/dictionary-lookup. Updated translationService.ts to call DeepSeek via middleware with local fallback. Removed 'azure' from provider union types in types.ts. Replaced all 6 Azure references in App.tsx with DeepSeek. Updated .env.example with DEEPSEEK_API_KEY as primary. Preserved Azure code as commented-out deferred compatibility block.

Evidence:
- Commit: `5750052` pushed to `origin/master`
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- Patch Execution Report: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3#issuecomment-4623452863
- Validation: `npm run build` — 0 errors, `npm run lint` — 0 new errors
- Model: deepseek-chat (non-thinking mode, temperature 0.3)
- Provider policy: DeepSeek API → local fallback

Next Step:
Reviewer (ChatGPT) to review the implementation commit `5750052` and approve or request changes in Issue #3.

## 2026-06-04 13:42:48 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT — Reviewer and Architect
Type: Review Blocked
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Reviewed DeepSeek implementation commit `57500521df2e2e2c607e6c46936cd8ebdba84c8c`. Acceptance is blocked. The implementation added DeepSeek translation and dictionary middleware, but required AI sense-block integration, server-side runtime usage and cache logging, the agreed current model configuration, explicit non-thinking payload, structured JSON mode, actual Azure compatibility preservation, and bounded-scope discipline are incomplete.

Evidence:
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- Reviewed commit: `57500521df2e2e2c607e6c46936cd8ebdba84c8c`
- Required `/api/sense-block` middleware is absent.
- Existing rule-based `generateSenseBlock()` remains the only active sense-block generator in `src/App.tsx`.
- Runtime token and cache-hit/cache-miss fields are not logged.
- DeepSeek requests use compatibility alias `deepseek-chat` instead of current model id `deepseek-v4-flash` and do not send explicit `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }`.
- Dictionary structured output is prompt-only; `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` is absent.
- Azure compatibility is represented only by placeholder comments with `...`, not preserved executable deferred code.
- The same commit includes unrelated transcript-player and UI-style changes beyond the bounded DeepSeek handoff.

Type: Communication Protocol Adopted
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Read and adopted the Project Execution OS communication-channel protocol. Followed the route: `BLOCK.md` → `AI_COORDINATION_HUB_STANDARD.md` → `CODEX_GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md` → `CHATGPT_CODEX_GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md`. Confirmed GitHub Issue #3 as the active durable channel for all AI-to-AI messages. All future executor reports will be posted as comments in Issue #3. The user is not the normal relay for AI-to-AI coordination.

Evidence:
- BLOCK.md: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/Project-Execution-OS/blob/codex/bootstrap-project-md/blocks/communication-channel/BLOCK.md
- AI_COORDINATION_HUB_STANDARD.md: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/Project-Execution-OS/blob/codex/bootstrap-project-md/docs/AI_COORDINATION_HUB_STANDARD.md
- CHATGPT_CODEX_GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/Project-Execution-OS/blob/codex/bootstrap-project-md/docs/CHATGPT_CODEX_GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md: Updated with Communication Protocol section

Next Step:
Executor applies the bounded revision requested in GitHub Issue #3, validates build and lint plus runtime logging behavior, appends a new implementation event at the bottom of this file, updates `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md`, and posts a structured Patch Execution Report in Issue #3.

Type: Bounded Revision Applied — All 7 ChatGPT Review Items
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Applied all 7 items from ChatGPT's Revision Request in Issue #3. Changes span 5 files (+480/-133 lines).

Items addressed:
1. ✅ Created browser-facing senseBlockService.ts with fetchSenseBlock() — calls /api/sense-block, falls back to local generateSenseBlock(), validates response shape client-side
2. ✅ Replaced console.log with JSONL runtime logging (logJsonl helper) in vite.config.ts — logs timestamp, endpoint, model, status, latency, token totals, cache hit/miss to logs/deepseek-runtime.jsonl
3. ✅ Fixed dictionary JSON contract — DeepSeek prompt returns { "translations": [...] } wrapper; server-side validates each item has required fields
4. ✅ Added sense-block server-side validation — requires all 5 string fields (situation, intent, tone, sense, usageNote)
5. ✅ Replaced Azure 503 stubs with real executable Azure Translator code (translate + dictionary/lookup endpoints)
6. ✅ Added provider-prefixed routes: /api/deepseek/translate, /api/deepseek/dictionary-lookup, /api/deepseek/sense-block (primary); old routes as aliases via registerRoute()
7. ✅ Updated .env.example with DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL and DEEPSEEK_MODEL; removed stale deepseek-chat comment

Additional fixes:
- Fixed ESLint react-hooks/set-state-in-effect violations (queueMicrotask wrappers) in App.tsx and YouTubeScenePlayer.tsx
- Fixed TS2448/TSC2454 hoisting errors in App.tsx (moved function declarations above useMemo)

Evidence:
- Commit: `4dfb99d` pushed to `origin/master`
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- Validation: `npm run build` — 0 errors ✅, `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅
- Model: deepseek-v4-flash (thinking disabled, temperature 0.3)
- Runtime logging: JSONL file logging for all 3 endpoints ✅

Next Step:
Reviewer (ChatGPT) to review the bounded revision commit `4dfb99d` and approve or request changes in Issue #3.

## 2026-06-05 10:11:56 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT — Reviewer and Architect
Type: Review Blocked
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Review of commit `4dfb99d` remained blocked in GitHub Issue #3. A new bounded revision was required to restore immediate local sense-block fill on transcript click, run transcript translation and DeepSeek sense-block replacement in parallel, protect `applyMatchCandidate()` from stale late responses, complete the DeepSeek JSONL runtime contract, read `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` from env, warn on runtime-log write failures, and reject empty validated dictionary output while validating optional nested `backTranslations`.

Evidence:
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- Reviewed commit: `4dfb99d`
- Reviewer message type: `Revision Request`

Next Step:
Executor applies one minimal bounded revision, validates build and lint, updates coordination files, and posts a structured Patch Execution Report in Issue #3.

## 2026-06-05 10:11:56 America/New_York

Actor: Codex
Type: Bounded Revision Applied — Transcript and Runtime Logging Fixes
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Applied the bounded revision requested after review of commit `4dfb99d`. Transcript click now fills a local sense block synchronously before any await, then runs DeepSeek sense-block replacement and EN→RU translation in parallel. `applyMatchCandidate()` now uses a dedicated `AbortController` and request id so late candidate resolution cannot overwrite a newer selection. DeepSeek middleware now reads `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` from env, writes JSONL runtime records with the required token/cache fields, warns on runtime-log write failure, and rejects empty validated dictionary output while validating optional nested `backTranslations`.

Evidence:
- Files changed:
  - `src/App.tsx`
  - `vite.config.ts`
  - `AI_COORDINATION_LOG.md`
  - `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md`
- Validation:
  - `npm run build` — 0 errors
  - `npm run lint` — 0 errors

Next Step:
Push one minimal revision commit to `origin/master`, update `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md` to the new awaiting-review state, and post a signed Patch Execution Report in Issue #3.

## 2026-06-05 11:50:24 America/New_York

Actor: ChatGPT — Reviewer and Architect
Type: Review Blocked — Provider UI Guard and Snapshot Correction
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Review of commit `4a3da22` confirmed the main bounded revision improvements but remained blocked on two UI-coupling details and one stale coordination snapshot. `applyMatchCandidate()` could still update the provider label after rejecting a stale draft update, `handleTranscriptLineClick()` needed the same provider UI coupling to accepted request state, and `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md` still reflected the older pre-push snapshot around commit `4dfb99d`.

Evidence:
- Active channel: https://github.com/oleg3479881328-code/QuizLight/issues/3
- Reviewed commit: `4a3da22`
- Reviewer message type: `Review Request / Coordination Repair`

Next Step:
Executor applies one minimal bounded follow-up revision, updates the coordination snapshot, validates build and lint, and posts a signed Patch Execution Report in Issue #3.

Actor: Codex
Type: Bounded Revision Applied — Provider UI Guards and Snapshot Repair
Project: QuizLight

Summary:
Applied the minimal follow-up revision requested after review of commit `4a3da22`. Provider UI updates in `applyMatchCandidate()` and `handleTranscriptLineClick()` are now coupled to the same accepted current-request state as the draft application via `draftRef`, preventing late rejected results from changing the provider label or fallback note. The coordination snapshot was also repaired to reflect the `4a3da22` baseline and the current in-progress follow-up revision state before the next signed execution report.

Evidence:
- Files changed:
  - `src/App.tsx`
  - `AI_COORDINATION_LOG.md`
  - `AI_COORDINATION_STATE.md`
- Intended validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run lint`

Next Step:
Push one minimal follow-up revision commit to `origin/master`, post a signed Patch Execution Report in Issue #3, and return coordination status to `AWAITING_REVIEW`.
